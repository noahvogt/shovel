# shovel

This is a program that helps me with 

- maintaining 
- forking
- automated building
- automated testing
- automated packaging
- automatically applying patches
- repository syncing and management

and possibly much more in the future. Shovel is heavily customized and tailored to my specific use case. There are seemingly millions of CI/CD Software Solutions already out there, but this will suit my needs just a little better, I think.
